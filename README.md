# Titan Framework: Core Installation Script

Using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) this script works making a work copy, with most recent TAG, of Git repository of Titan Framework's [CORE](https://github.com/titan-framework/core).

It's especially useful to install the core of Titan Framework on servers (with test, homologation or production environment). To use, you need [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download) and [install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) on server, and do:

```bash
composer create-project titan-framework/install path/to/local/folder
```
